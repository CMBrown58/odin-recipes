          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups fresh orange juice, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin
            </li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper
            </li>
            <li>3 pounds trimmed skirt steaks</li>
            <li>16 (6 inch) white corn tortillas, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 white onion, chopped, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 small bunch fresh cilantro, chopped, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine orange juice, 2 tablespoons cilantro, lime juice, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, and cayenne in a large freezer bag. Submerge skirt steaks in the marinade. Seal the bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate, 1 to 8 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat a grill to medium-high. Grill the steaks until hot and firm in the center or to your preferred doneness, 6 to 8 minutes per side. Transfer steaks to a flat work surface and slice as thinly as possible against the grain.</li>
            <li>Heat corn tortillas on the grill or in a microwave. Keep tortillas warm in a folded sheet of aluminum foil covered by a thick towel.</li>
            <li>Add steak to each tortilla and top with white onion and cilantro.</li>
            <p>You can substitute flank steak for the skirt steak. Feel free to broil the meat instead of grilling it, if you prefer.

                To heat tortillas in the microwave, place them between wet paper towels and microwave for 1 minute. They should become pliable and fragrant. Wet paper towel between batches.</p>
